Book Recommendation System for Goodreads Book dataset using different model based and memory based techniques. Different collaborative filtering methods were used.
Model based techniques were used to built user-based collaborative filtering system (NMF, SVD, SVD++ and Co-clustering), 
Memory based techniques were used to build user-based, item based and content based filtering.
Deep learning model is also explored for the user-based filtering utilizing matrix factorization.
